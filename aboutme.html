        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Zachary Purser, the creator of this Pokémon Guessing Game. I'm a huge Pokémon fan and wanted to create a fun and challenging game for others to enjoy. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had making it!</p>
        <p>This game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're interested in learning more about web development or have any questions about the game, feel free to reach out to me!</p>
